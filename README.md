# Terraform module: Virtual Machine (EC2, AutoScaling Group)

Create X EC2/AutoScaling Group instances with X extra volumes, encrypted by default.

This module creates the same kind of instances.
They share the same features.
To create different instances, calls this module multiple times.

## Notes

To install pre-commit hooks: `pre-commit install`.
It will automatically `validate`, `fmt` and update *README.md* for you.

| cpu\_core\_count | Sets the number of CPU cores for an instance. This option is only supported on creation of instance type that support CPU Options CPU Cores and Threads Per CPU Core Per Instance Type - specifying this option for unsupported instance types will return an error from the EC2 API. | `number` | `null` | no |
